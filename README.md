# Examples

Just some examples, experiments and references for local use.

## List

* api_to_elastic - Fetching API data and saving it to elasticsearch, then retrieving and graphing the data. Using Covid data API's since there are a few of those around right now. (Using PHP 7.4, Elasticsearch, Bootstrap and Google Charts, under Valet on Mac.)

* mybusmap - A very simple, quick'n'dirty, single-page "app" to display the real-time locations of a few local buses. It uses the https://www.bus-data.dft.gov.uk/ API for bus location data and https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ for maps. There is no cache as the data has to be live to be useful. On mobiles it uses the phone's current location to centre the map. (Using PHP 7.4, under Valet on Mac for development then a standard CentOS/Plesk server for live use.)

* wordle - A simple word finder for Wordle. UK, USA and combined dictionaries. Just a simple interface, built on a Saturday ready for Sunday's word. Although, 9 times out of 10 I can find the word without help. (Using PHP 7.4, MySQL and Bootstrap, under Valet on Mac.)
