# Examples

Just some examples, experiments and references for local use.

## List

* api_to_elastic - Fetching API data and saving it to elasticsearch, then retrieving and graphing the data. Using Covid data API's since there are a few of those around right now. (Using PHP 7.4, Elasticsearch, Bootstrap and Google Charts, under Valet on Mac.)

* wordle - A simple word finder for Wordle. UK, USA and combined dictionaries. Just a simple interface, built on a Saturday ready for Sunday's word. Although, 9 times out of 10 I can find the word without help. (Using PHP 7.4, MySQL and Bootstrap, under Valet on Mac.)
